# Hi, I'm Miranda!

Iâ€™m a systems-minded data analyst and programmer focused on building scalable, sustainable infrastructure to support research, healthcare, and mission-driven teams. I specialize in workflow automation, data pipelines, and human-centered analytics that make complex operations more efficient and accessible.

With 9+ years of experience across academic research, nonprofit operations, and small business systems, I bring a pragmatic and adaptable approach to data work, balancing structure and flexibility to meet real-world needs. Iâ€™m especially passionate about streamlining research processes, automating repetitive tasks, and designing data systems that empower teams to do their best work.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Working On

- **PEARL (Participant Engagement and Research Lifecycle):** Leading data pipeline and infrastructure development for a HIPAA-compliant research workflow platform at the University of Michigan Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Center. Integrating REDCap, SharePoint Lists, Power Automate, and R to streamline participant tracking and reduce manual processes.

- **Analytics Engineering Practice Project:** Designing a reproducible analytics engineering workflow using **dbt**, **PostgreSQL**, and **open datasets** to demonstrate modular data transformation pipelines. *(Repo coming soon!)*

- **Open Science Website (Data Core @ Michigan ADRC):** Building [a public-facing site](https://michiganadc.github.io/dmsc-madc/) using **Quarto** and **GitHub Pages** to share research outputs, data dictionaries, and analytic tools from the Data Management & Statistical Core. Focused on transparency, accessibility, and sustainability for long-term research collaboration.

- **REDCap + R Automation Toolkit:** Developing internal tools to automate data archiving, REDCap API integration, and documentation processes using R and Task Scheduler. Aims to support reproducible workflows and reduce friction for research staff.
